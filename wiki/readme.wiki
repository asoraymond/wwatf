wwatf1.0 finished. 

Introduction.

Based on the requirement of the testing process and testing automation, I finished the wwatf1.0 , using ruby+watir . 

Main idea is read the cases from a excel or multi excel doc ,then run the cases in IE. 
The other feature:
1- save current screen 
2- a dict recorder.
